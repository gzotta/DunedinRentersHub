# DunedinRentersHub
This web application will act as a central hub for finding flats in North Dunedin where landlords can list their flats with links to separate websites 
and renters can build up a profile with references and can group up with other people they're looking to flat with. This will enable renters to form one application 
that they can send to many landlords, book flat viewings that work for their group members and the landlord online, and filter search features such as car parking,
bedrooms, or locations.

Application's design:
- The application will use the Jooby REST web services framework to communicate between client and server. 
- AJAX client with Angular JS to create dynamic web pages. 
- H2 database as persitence data storage.
